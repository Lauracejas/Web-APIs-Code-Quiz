## Description

- In this repository I modified the starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected.
- Following the requirements, I created the code in JavaScript trying to have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
- I commented each step creating the code for futures developers understand.

## Instructions

- The first view of the application displays a button that starts the quiz.
- Clicking the start button displays a series of questions.
- Once the quiz begins, a timer starts.
- If a question is answered incorrectly, additional time is subtracted from the timer.
- The timer stops when all questions have been answered or the timer reaches 0.
- After the game ends, the user can save their initials and score to a highscores view using local storage.
